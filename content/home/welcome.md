## <span style="color:white">  ABOUT </span>

### <span style="color:white"> Our aim </span>
<span style="color:white; font-size:10.0pt"> The Shiftability study aims to improve understanding of the differences in brain chemistry between people with and without conditions like autism. We are working with adults (ages 18 to 65) from various backgrounds and communities. We use a combination of state-of-the-art neuroimaging tools alongside traditional behavioural assessments to capture specific brain characteristics of neurotypical and neurodiverse people. We also explore the ways in which different brains respond to drugs which target various neurosignalling pathways. </span>

### <span style="color:white"> Our methods </span>
<span style="color:white"> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning is a safe way of producing detailed images of the brain using magnetism. It does not use any form of ionising radiation (unlike X-ray) or radioactive substances (unlike PET imaging). Electroencephalography (EEG) is another safe way to study the brain by recording brain signals moment by moment. We use these tools to capture the response to single doses of drugs which briefly shift brain signalling. The drugs used in our projects have been extensively tested and found to be generally safe. For example, tianeptine (an antidepressant), cannabidiol, arbaclofen and soon, low dose psilocybin. </span>

### <span style="color:white"> Our collaborations </span>
<span style="color:white"> As part of the AIMS-2-TRIALS project - the largest mental health study in Europe â€“ we collaborate with an international network of scientists to gain new insights regarding the structure, function and chemistry of conditions such as autism. Everyone who is neurodiverse is different and we want to understand what biology is shared and what is unique to each individual. </span>

### <span style="color:white"> Making a difference  </span>
<span style="color:white"> We hope that our projects will expedite the discovery and development of novel strategies to tackle some of the difficulties that some people with conditions like autism experience daily. We hope that this would ultimately improve their physical and mental health and well-being while also preserving their unique and valuable skills. </span>
