## Welcome to the **Shiftability Lab**.

### Neurosignalling and neurodiversity
The human brain contains about 100 billion neurons which are the building blocks of our nervous system. They are connected in a variety of ways and form networks which are specialised for different human behaviours.
Communication across brain networks depends on chemical signals.
Differences in these brain networks and the chemicals associated with them make each person unique. We want to explore these differences in people with and without neurodiverse conditions such as autism.

### Our aim
The Shiftability study aims to improve understanding of the differences in brain chemistry between people with and without conditions like autism. We are working with adults (ages 18 to 65) from various backgrounds and communities. We use a combination of state-of-the-art tools such as MRI and EEG scans alongside traditional behavioural assessments to capture specific brain characteristics of neurotypical and neurodiverse people. We also explore the ways in which different brains respond to drugs which target various neurosignalling pathways.

### Our focus
MRI scanning is a safe way of producing detailed images of the brain using magnetism. It does not use any form of ionising radiation (unlike X-ray) or radioactive substances (unlike PET imaging). EEG is another safe way to study the brain by recording brain signals moment by moment. We use these tools to capture the response to single doses of drugs which briefly shift brain signalling. The drugs used in our projects have been extensively tested and found to be generally safe. For example, Tianeptine (an antidepressant), cannabidiol, arbaclofen and soon low dose psilocybin.

We particularly want to understand whether there are brain signalling differences between neurotypical and neurodiverse individuals.

### Our collaborations
As part of the AIMS-2-TRIALS project - the largest mental health study in Europe â€“ we collaborate with an international network of scientists to gain new insights regarding the structure, function and chemistry of conditions such as autism. Everyone who is neurodiverse is different and we want to understand what biology is shared and what is unique to each individual. 

### Making a difference
We hope that our projects will expedite the discovery and development of novel strategies to tackle some of the difficulties that some people with conditions like autism experience daily. We hope that this would ultimately improve their physical and mental health and well-being while also preserving their unique and valuable skills.
