<h4> <span style="color:white"> Our aim </span> </h4>

<p> <div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; text-align-last:center; border-style: dotted; margin-right: -100px; width: 100\%; color:white; font-size:14.0pt"> Our brains are constantly at work, even at rest. Our aim is to better understand dynamic brain function, including in neurodiverse individuals. We are working with adults (ages 18 to 65) from various backgrounds and communities. We use drugs which target different chemical systems to understand how brain function is regulated. We call these studies ‘Shiftability’ studies because they measure what shifts or changes in the brain in response to a single dose of a drug. </div>

#### <span style="color:white"> Our methods </span>
<span style="color:white; font-size:14.0pt"> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning is a safe way of producing detailed images of the brain using magnetism. It does not use any form of ionising radiation (unlike X-ray) or radioactive substances (unlike PET imaging). Electroencephalography (EEG) is another safe way to study the brain by recording brain signals moment by moment. We use these tools to capture the response to single doses of drugs which briefly shift brain signalling. The drugs used in our projects have been extensively tested and found to be generally safe. For example, they act on the serotonin brain chemical system (citalopram and soon psilocybin), the GABA chemical system (arbaclofen) and/or have multiple brain targets (the novel antidepressant tianeptine, cannabidiol). </span>

#### <span style="color:white"> Our collaborations </span>
<span style="color:white; font-size:14.0pt"> As part of the AIMS-2-TRIALS project - the largest mental health study in Europe – we collaborate with an international network of scientists to gain fresh insights regarding the structure, function and chemistry of neurodiverse conditions such as autism. Everyone who is neurodiverse is different and we want to understand what biology is shared and what is unique to each individual. </span>

#### <span style="color:white"> Making a difference  </span>
<span style="color:white; font-size:14.0pt"> We hope that our projects will expedite the discovery and development of novel strategies to tackle some of the difficulties that some people with conditions like autism experience daily. We hope that this provides more options for people to support their mental health and well-being while also preserving every person’s strengths and skills. </span>
