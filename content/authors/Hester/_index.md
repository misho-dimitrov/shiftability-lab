I started working at the FANS department at the IoPPN, King’s College London as a Clinical Research Worker in November 2016. Currently, I am working on my PhD project investigating the role of cerebral GABAergic circuitry in the Excitation-Inhibition balance in autistic adults.  

Previously, I have obtained an MSc in Medicine from the Free University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and a Research MSc in Life Sciences from the Paris Descartes University, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in France.
