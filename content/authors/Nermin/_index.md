As a Clinician working in CAMHS, I have always had an interest in translational research that can help improve our understanding of mental health problems especially in the neurodiverse population. 

I graduated from Faculty of medicine, Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt in 2002. I completed my psychiatry training in Egypt then worked in different Middle Eastern countries before moving to the UK. I got an MSc in child and adolescent mental health from IOPPN in 2013. I joined higher training in Child psychiatry in the Maudsley Higher training Scheme. After becoming a consultant child psychiatrist in the UK, I started to develop further my research skills. I started as a part time PhD student in Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences (FANS) in October 2021. I also started working with Shiftability research team in 2022.
