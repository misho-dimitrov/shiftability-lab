I completed in my MSc in Developmental Psychology and Psychopathology in 2021 and joined the MRC Doctoral Training Partnership in Biomedical Sciences at King's College London in 2023.

My PhD focuses on dynamic functional brain connectivity and neurochemical systems in autism. Before joining Kingâ€™s, I completed my BSc in Bioscience at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
