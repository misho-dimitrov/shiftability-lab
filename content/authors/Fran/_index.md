I joined the Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences at King’s College London in June 2023 as a Research Assistant in the Shiftability group, where I am currently working on two different pharmacologic studies targeting the serotonin and GABA systems in Autism (the latter as part of EU-AIMS). Prior to starting in my current role, I worked for Imperial College Healthcare as an MRI assistant at a community diagnostic hub, after earning a First-Class honours degree in Psychology and an MSc in Clinical Neuropsychiatry from King’s. For my MSc research project, I audited a clinical neurophysiology service to assess the roles of video-EEG telemetry and activation procedures in capturing and diagnosing non-epileptic seizures.
