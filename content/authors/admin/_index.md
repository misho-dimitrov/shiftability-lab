I am a PhD student at the Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences (IoPPN, KCL). My project involves the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effect of several different drugs on functional brain connectivity in autistic and neurotypical individuals. The overall aim of the study is to improve our understanding of neurobiological and neurochemical mechanisms in autism and typical development. To achieve this, I first investigated baseline functional brain connectivity, or the manner in which brain regions are connected and communicate with each other. I then examined how connectivity is affected by modulating different chemical systems in the brain, incl. serotonergic, opioidergic and GABAergic. I also made an attempt to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed drug-induced shifts by combining our MRI data with freely available Positron Emission Tomography-based chemical receptor maps. Finally, I assessed whether baseline functional brain connectivity could be used as a stratification biomarker to predict drug response.

Overall, I am interested in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, and how they could be studied and modelled using various tools, such as pharmacological probing, multimodal neuroimaging, and advanced computational and statistical methods. I am also curious about how this knowledge could be translated into real-world practices and technologies that could be introduced in the clinical domain as well as in people's every-day life. 

I am also a graduate teaching assistant and an associate fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Over the past 4 years, I have contributed to several undergraduate and postgraduate courses at King's, including as a neuroscience tutor (BSc Neuroscience), neuroanatomy and neurophysiology demonstrator (BSc Neuroscience, Year I \& II Medicine and Dental Medicine), research methods and statistics demonstrator, and chief postgraduate tutor (MSc Clinical Neurodevelopmental Sciences).
