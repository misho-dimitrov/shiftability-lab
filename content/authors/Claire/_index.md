I joined the Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences at Kingâ€™s College London in 2016 as a Research Assistant on the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP).

Since then, I have worked on two other research assistant posts at the SGDP (KCL) and at Birkbeck, University of London before completing my PhD back at the Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences in 2023. My PhD focussed on the investigation of novel proxy markers of excitatory- inhibitory (E-I) signalling using human EEG.

Prior to joining KCL I completed my BSc in Psychology and MSc in Psychological Research Methods at the University of Sheffield.
