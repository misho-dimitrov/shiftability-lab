I received my Bachelor degree in Automatic Control and Information Technology from Beihang University in 2013 and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from University of Southern California in 2015. I completed my Ph.D. in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System at South China University of Technology in 2019. I started working at the IoPPN as Postdoctoral Research Associate since Jan. 2020.

My current research interests include i) test the hypothesis that there is a dynamic difference in GABA systems in ASD (using EEG) which constitutes a treatment target; ii) to objectively measure target engagement; and iii) improve stratification.
