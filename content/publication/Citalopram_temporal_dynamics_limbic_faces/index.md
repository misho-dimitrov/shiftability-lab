abstract: Emotion processing—including signals from facial expressions—is often
  altered in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The biological
  basis of this is poorly understood but may include neurochemically mediated
  differences in the responsivity of key ‘limbic’ regions (including amygdala,
  ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)). Emerging
  evidence also suggests that ASD may be a disorder of brain temporal dynamics.
  Moreover, serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be a key regulator of both
  facial-emotion processing and brain dynamics, and 5-HT abnormalities have been
  consistently implicated in ASD. To date, however, no one has examined how 5-HT
  influences the dynamics of facial-emotion processing in ASD. Therefore, we
  compared the influence of 5-HT on the responsivity of brain dynamics during
  facial-emotion processing in individuals with and without ASD. Participants
  completed a facial-emotion processing fMRI task at least 8 days apart using a
  randomised double-blind crossover design. At each visit they received either a
  single 20-mg oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
  citalopram or placebo. We found that citalopram (which increases levels of
  5-HT) caused sustained activation in key limbic regions during processing of
  negative facial emotions in adults with ASD—but not in neurotypical adults.
  The neurotypical adults’ limbic response reverted more rapidly to baseline
  following a 5-HT-challenge. Our results suggest that serotonergic homoeostatic
  control of the temporal dynamics in limbic regions is altered in adults with
  ASD, and provide a fresh perspective on the biology of ASD.
