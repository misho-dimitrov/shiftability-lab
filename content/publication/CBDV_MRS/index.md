abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a high cost neurodevelopmental
  condition; and there are currently no effective pharmacological treatments for
  its core symptoms. This has led some families and researchers to trial
  alternative remedies – including the non-intoxicating Cannabis sativa-derived
  compound cannabidivarin (CBDV). However, how CBDV affects the human brain is
  unknown. Previous (pre)clinical evidence suggests that CBDV may modulate brain
  excitatory-inhibitory systems, which are implicated in ASD. Hence, our main
  aim was to test, for the first time, if CBDV shifts glutamate and/or GABA
  metabolites – markers of the brain’s primary excitatory and inhibitory system
  - in both the ‘typical’ and autistic brain. Our subsidiary aim was to
  determine whether, within ASD, brain responsivity to CBDV challenge is related
  to baseline biological phenotype. We tested this using a repeated-measures,
  double-blind, randomized-order, cross-over design. We used magnetic resonance
  spectroscopy (MRS) to compare glutamate (Glx = glutamate + glutamine) and
  GABA + (GABA + macromolecules) levels following placebo (baseline) and 600 mg
  CBDV in 34 healthy men with (n = 17) and without (n = 17) ASD. Data
  acquisition from regions previously reliably linked to ASD (dorsomedial
  prefrontal cortex, DMPFC; left basal ganglia, BG) commenced 2 h (peak plasma
  levels) after placebo/CBDV administration. Where CBDV significantly shifted
  metabolite levels, we examined the relationship of this change with baseline
  metabolite levels. Test sessions were at least 13 days apart to ensure CBDV
  wash-out. CBDV significantly increased Glx in the BG of both groups. However,
  this impact was not uniform across individuals. In the ASD group, and not in
  the typically developing controls, the ‘shift’ in Glx correlated negatively
  with baseline Glx concentration. In contrast, CBDV had no significant impact
  on Glx in the DMPFC, or on GABA+ in either voxel in either group. Our findings
  suggest that, as measured by MRS, CBDV modulates the glutamate-GABA system in
  the BG but not in frontal regions. Moreover, there is individual variation in
  response depending on baseline biochemistry. Future studies should examine the
  effect of CBDV on behaviour and if the response to an acute dose of CBDV could
  predict a potential clinical treatment response in ASD.
