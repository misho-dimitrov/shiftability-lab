  Sensory atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to arise
  at least partly from differences in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor
  function. However, the evidence to date has been indirect, arising from
  correlational studies in patients and preclinical models. Here, we evaluated
  the role of GABA receptor directly, in 44 adults (n = 19 ASD). Baseline
  concentration of occipital lobe GABA+ (GABA plus coedited macromolecules) was
  measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Steady-state
  visual evoked potential (SSVEP) elicited by a passive visual surround
  suppression paradigm was compared after double-blind randomized oral
  administration of placebo or 15 to 30 mg of arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B
  (GABAB) receptor agonist. In the placebo condition, the neurotypical SSVEP
  response was affected by both the foreground stimuli contrast and background
  interference (suppression). In ASD, however, all stimuli conditions had equal
  salience and background suppression of the foreground response was weaker. In
  the placebo condition, although there was no difference in GABA+ between
  groups, GABA+ concentration positively correlated with response to maximum
  foreground contrast during maximum background interference in neurotypicals,
  but not ASD. In neurotypicals, sensitivity to visual stimuli was disrupted by
  30 mg of arbaclofen, whereas in ASD, it was made more “typical” and visual
  processing differences were abolished. Hence, differences in GABAergic
  function are fundamental to autistic (visual) sensory neurobiology and are
  modulated by GABAB activity.

summary: >
  Alterations in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–related pathways have been shown to
  occur in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the role of
  GABA signaling modulation on sensory processing remains unclear. Now, Huang et
  al. show that visual processing, altered in patients with ASD, could be
  restored, promoting GABAB receptor activation using arbaclofen. The results
  suggest that GABA signaling alterations in ASD play a critical role in
  determining visual sensory responses and suggest that interventions promoting
  GABAergic activity might ameliorate sensory impairments in ASD.
