  There is increasing interest in the use of cannabis and its major
  non-intoxicating component cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment for mental health
  and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
  However, before launching large-scale clinical trials, a better understanding
  of the effects of CBD on brain would be desirable. Preclinical evidence
  suggests that one aspect of the polypharmacy of CBD is that it modulates brain
  excitatory glutamate and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels,
  including in brain regions linked to ASD, such as the basal ganglia (BG) and
  the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). However, differences in glutamate
  and GABA pathways in ASD mean that the response to CBD in people with and
  without ASD may be not be the same. To test whether CBD 'shifts' glutamate and
  GABA levels; and to examine potential differences in this response in ASD, we
  used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure glutamate (Glx =
  glutamate + glutamine) and GABA+ (GABA + macromolecules) levels in 34 healthy
  men (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD). Data acquisition commenced 2 h (peak plasma
  levels) after a single oral dose of 600 mg CBD or placebo. Test sessions were
  at least 13 days apart. Across groups, CBD increased subcortical, but
  decreased cortical, Glx. Across regions, CBD increased GABA+ in controls, but
  decreased GABA+ in ASD; the group difference in change in GABA + in the DMPFC
  was significant. Thus, CBD modulates glutamate-GABA systems, but
  prefrontal-GABA systems respond differently in ASD. Our results do not speak
  to the efficacy of CBD. Future studies should examine the effects of chronic
  administration on brain and behaviour, and whether acute brain changes predict
  longer-term response.
