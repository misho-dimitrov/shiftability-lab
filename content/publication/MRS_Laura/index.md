abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects over 1:100 of the population
  and costs the UK more than £32bn and the USA more than $175bn (£104bn)
  annually. Its core symptoms are social and communication difficulties,
  repetitive behaviours and sensory hyper- or hypo-sensitivities. A highly
  diverse phenotypic presentation likely reflects its etiological heterogeneity
  and makes finding treatment targets for ASD challenging. In addition, there
  are no means to identify biologically responsive individuals who may benefit
  from specific interventions. There is hope however, and in this review we
  consolidate how findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) add to the
  evidence that differences in the brain's excitatory glutamate and inhibitory
  γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) balance may be both a key biomarker and a tractable
  treatment target in ASD.
