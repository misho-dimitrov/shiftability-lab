abstract: Currently, there are no effective pharmacologic treatments for the
  core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There is, nevertheless,
  potential for progress. For example, recent evidence suggests that the
  excitatory (E) glutamate and inhibitory (I) GABA systems may be altered in
  ASD. However, no prior studies of ASD have examined the ‘responsivity’ of the
  E–I system to pharmacologic challenge; or whether E–I modulation alters
  abnormalities in functional connectivity of brain regions implicated in the
  disorder. Therefore, we used magnetic resonance spectroscopy ([1H]MRS) to
  measure prefrontal E–I flux in response to the glutamate and GABA acting drug
  riluzole in adult men with and without ASD. We compared the change in
  prefrontal ‘Inhibitory Index’—the GABA fraction within the pool of glutamate
  plus GABA metabolites—post riluzole challenge; and the impact of riluzole on
  differences in resting-state functional connectivity. Despite no baseline
  differences in E–I balance, there was a significant group difference in
  response to pharmacologic challenge. Riluzole increased the prefrontal cortex
  inhibitory index in ASD but decreased it in controls. There was also a
  significant group difference in prefrontal functional connectivity at
  baseline, which was abolished by riluzole within the ASD group. Our results
  also show, for we believe the first time in ASD, that E–I flux can be
  ‘shifted’ with a pharmacologic challenge, but that responsivity is
  significantly different from controls. Further, our initial evidence suggests
  that abnormalities in functional connectivity can be ‘normalised’ by targeting
  E–I, even in adults.
