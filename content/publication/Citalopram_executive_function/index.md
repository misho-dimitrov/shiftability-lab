abstract: Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are frequently prescribed
  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, there is limited
  evidence to support this practice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the
  impact of SSRIs on brain function abnormalities in ASD. It has been suggested
  that some core symptoms in ASD are underpinned by deficits in executive
  functioning (EF). Hence, we investigated the role of the SSRI citalopram on EF
  networks in 19 right-handed adult males with ASD and 19 controls who did not
  differ in gender, age, IQ or handedness. We performed pharmacological
  functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity during two EF
  tasks (of response inhibition and sustained attention) after an acute dose of
  20 mg citalopram or placebo using a randomised, double-blind, crossover
  design. Under placebo condition, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain
  activation in response inhibition regions, including inferior frontal,
  precentral and postcentral cortices and cerebellum. During sustained
  attention, individuals with ASD had abnormal brain activation in middle
  temporal cortex and (pre)cuneus. After citalopram administration, abnormal
  brain activation in inferior frontal cortex was ‘normalised’ and most of the
  other brain functional differences were ‘abolished’. Also, within ASD, the
  degree of responsivity in inferior frontal and postcentral cortices to SSRI
  challenge was related to plasma serotonin levels. These findings suggest that
  citalopram can ‘normalise’ atypical brain activation during EF in ASD. Future
  trials should investigate whether this shift in the biology of ASD is
  maintained after prolonged citalopram treatment, and if peripheral measures of
  serotonin predict treatment response.
